            <br><h2>Overview</h2>
            <P> Group members: Rachel Bell, Gabriella Boozer, Kasandra Duckett, Maura Jarman</P>
            <p> Role: UX/UI Design, Research, Wireframing, Usability Testing, Prototyping</p>
            <p>Problem: Despite the invaluable contributions of volunteers to Girls Rock! DC, there exists a gap in the availability of comprehensive and easily accessible information about volunteering with the organization. The lack of detailed information poses a challenge to potential volunteers who are seeking to engage with Girls Rock! DC, hindering their understanding of available roles, expectations, and the volunteer signup process.
                Proposed Solution: Developing a user-friendly webpage that offers clear and thorough insights into volunteering opportunities and simplifies the signup process is essential to not only enhance the volunteer experience but also to encourage more local residents to actively participate in empowering young girls through Girls Rock DC.</p>
               <br><img class="GirlsRock" src="Images/GRDCbrand.jpg" alt="GirlsRock" /> <br>
           <br> <H3> Approach</H3>
               <p>We used Figma Jam and Miro to brainstorm for this project and Google Drive to organize our research. We organized the project into steps, using Trello to monitor and adhere to timelines. We used Figma to create our wireframes and prototype.
                We also communicated regularly via Slack and text to ensure we were on target and troubleshoot any bottlenecks in our timeline.</p>
            <H4>Research</H4>
            <P>First, we created our proto persona to best understand our assumed user.</P>
            <br><img class="ProtoPersona" src="Images/ProtoPersona.jpg" alt="ProtoPersona" /><br>
            <br><P> In order to redesign this website with the users’ best interests and experience in mind, we performed multiple modes of research, including:
                    Heuristic evaluation of the current site
                    Competitor analysis
                    Stakeholder contact
                    User interviews and survey
            </P>
            <P>Based on these, we identified several areas for improvement:
                Color scheme and patterns feel overwhelming and lack simplicity
                Limited volunteer information (could have more text but also video to better understand organization goals and activities)
                Information architecture is not intuitive at times</P>
            <H5> Defining Our User:
                User Persona</H5>
            <P>Dhalia, a student and bartender in the DMV, is pursuing a Master's in Social Work with a passion for working in schools. Alongside her love for her cat and weekend hangouts with friends, she aims to engage in community involvement and pursue music. Dhalia seeks a volunteer role that intertwines youth mentorship and the arts.</P>

            <img class="UserPersona1" src="Images/UserPersona1.jpg" alt="UserPersona1" />
            <img class="UserPersona2" src="Images/UserPersona2.jpg" alt="UserPersona2" />
            </div>
        <br><H6>User Insight Statements:</H6>
                    Dahlia aims to engage in volunteer work with an organization that shares her values and passions. This way, she can enhance her sense of community connection, contribute to empowering the upcoming generation, and also rediscover her musical inclinations.
                    Dahlia, a dedicated Master’s student juggling a demanding schedule, is eager to engage in volunteering with an organization aligned with her passions. However, she seeks an opportunity that provides a well-defined understanding of her role, responsibilities, and the time commitment involved.</P>
        <br><H7> Problem Statement:</H7>
            <P>When a professional wants to dedicate their time as a volunteer for a local community non-profit, finding an organization that shares their passions and beliefs becomes pivotal. This mutual alignment allows them to give back to society while also reaping the benefits of community engagement. How can we create a well-defined and concise web page that articulates the value volunteers bring to the table and establishes unambiguous guidelines for potential volunteers?</P>

                <br><img class="Storyboard" src="Images/Storyboard.jpg" alt="Storyboard" /><br>
                <br><P> All of these brainstorming sessions led us into card sorting to develop our sitemap and iterate a new design to create an improved user flow and ease of navigation throughout the site.</P>
                <div class="sitemaps">
                <img class="Sitemap1" src="Images/Sitemap1.jpg" alt="Sitemap1" />
                <img class="Sitemap2" src="Images/Sitemap2.jpg" alt="Sitemap2" /><br>

                <br><img class="Sitekey" src="Images/SiteKey.jpg" alt="SiteKey" /><br>
        <br><H9> Low/Mid-Fidelity Wireframing & User Testing</H9><br>
                <P> We had four user tests (two on desktop, two on mobile) on mid-fidelity prototype after wireframe creation to obtain insights regarding user flow and information architecture. Below are highlighted flags/issues we identified:        </P>
                <div class="wireframes">
                <img class="Wireframe1" src="Images/wireframe1.jpg" alt="Wireframe1" />
                <img class="wireframe2" src="Images/wireframe2.jpg" alt="wireframe2" /> <br>
                </div>
               <br> <P> Key Takeaways:
                Some pages felt text heavy
                Missing breadcrumbs for sign up form (two pages)
                Some minor prototyping issues (drop down menus, etc.)
                No separation for optional pathway to email rather than calendar</P> <br>
           <br> <H10> Iterated High-Fidelity Wireframing & More Testing:</H10> <br>
           <br> <P> Key Takeaways:
                Continued adjustments to streamline and optimize sign up form
                Added “X” icon for exit pathway for calendar date overlay, allowing for user to correct date or search other dates if needed
                Added “X” icon for success page rather than delay to empower user
                Improved image quality and other small UI adjustments
            </P>
            <br><H11> Final Prototype</H11><br>

                </div>
             <br><H12>Reflection</H12><br>
                <P> With more time we would love to:
                    Test potential or current site users
                    Get input and feedback from our stakeholders
                    Hone and sharpen our drop-down menu functionality
                    Make the design fully responsive, rather than adaptive
                </P>
